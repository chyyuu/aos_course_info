### OS Architecture
 1. [The Structure of the "THE"-Multiprogramming System](http://uosis.mif.vu.lt/~liutauras/books/Dijkstra%20-%20The%20structure%20of%20the%20THE%20multiprogramming%20system.pdf),
Edsger W. Dijkstra ,Technological University, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, SOSP, 1968 
    
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** The first paper to suggest that an operating system be built in a structured way. That structure was a series of layers, each a virtual machine that introduced abstractions built using the functionality of lower layer. The paper stimulated a great deal of subsequent work in building operating systems as structured systems.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  The Tenex system pioneered many ideas that are prominent in modern operating systems. It included one of the first page based memory systems, copy on write sharing, mapping of files into virtual memory, and user/group/other file protection. It also had mnemonic commands with command-line completion and automatic file versioning. As one reviewer said, “Reading it now, I’m pleasantly surprised by how much is familiar — thanks to its successors.”
 1. [On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/361598.361623), David. L. Parnas., Communications of the ACM 15(12), December 1972, 1053-1058. 
    
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper introduced a technique for decomposing a complex system into modules. Through a simple example it showed that a modularization that emphasizes what is now known as “information hiding” is superior to more obvious module decompositions in terms of the software engineering lifecycle. The paper argues the beneficial decomposition can be achieved with minimal performance overheads. The “information hiding” approach has influenced software engineering in areas including operating systems, distributed systems, databases, and programming languages. 
 1. [On Micro-Kernel Construction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/224056.224075),J. Liedtke., ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review 29(5):237-250 · December 1995
    
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**   This paper presented the core design ideas behind the L4 microkernel, especially the minimality principle, which states that functionality must only be implemented inside the kernel if moving it outside would prevent the implementation of required system functionality. This principle was at the heart of L4’s design, and supported a ruthless performance focus, which allowed L4 to outperform other microkernels by an order of magnitude. The core ideas of this paper led to a family of L4 microkernels which were commercially deployed on a large scale, and eventually enabled unprecedented assurance through formal verification.

     - The idea of sharing address space between multiple processes is not new. So why is a new model needed? The answer lies with advances in high-performance computing, notably many-core computers with more parallelism in a node and frequent communication  between processes. Unlike other models, PiP’s design is completely in user space.

     - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper introduced the notion of optimistic concurrency control, proceeding with a transaction without locking the data items accessed, in the expectation that the transaction’s accesses will not conflict with those of other transactions. This idea, originally introduced in the context of conventional databases, has proven very powerful when transactions are applied to general-purpose systems.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** The paper introduces a replication protocol very similar to what is now known as Paxos. That protocol has become the standard for consistent, fault-tolerant state-machine replication, and is widely used in data centers to keep the state consistent despite failures and reconfiguration.
 1. [The Part Time Parliament](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=279229),Leslie Lamport. ACM TOCS 16(2), May 1998, 133–169.
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** The work (originally published in 1989) was independent and roughly concurrent with the Viewstamped Replication work also recognized this year. It describes the protocol in a more general setting, adds a correctness argument, and forms the basis for modern Paxos implementations.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper takes the idea of consistency for distributed predicate evaluation, formalizes it, distinguishes between stable and dynamic predicates, and shows precise conditions for correct detection of stable conditions. The fundamental techniques in the paper are the secret sauce in many distributed algorithms for deadlock detection, termination detection, consistent checkpointing for fault tolerance, global predicate detection for debugging and monitoring, and distributed simulation.
 1. [Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37515), Kenneth P. Birman and Thomas A. Joseph. SOSP 1987.
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper describes a methodology for building distributed applications comprised of multiple components, each realized by a group of replicated servers. It defines a number of group communication primitives and then ties fault notification into the fabric of group services by introducing the virtual synchrony principle, which orders communication and fault notifications consistently among group members and across multiple groups.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  Bayou is a replicated storage system that anticipated the world of numerous small mobile devices executing collaborative applications over unreliable networks. The paper describes a client-server storage structure supporting eventual consistency, anti-entropy protocols, disconnected operation, log-based recovery, and an application-centered approach to detecting and resolving update conflicts to arrive at consistent replicas. These concepts were backed up by a prototype implementation, two applications, and a simple performance evaluation. Bayou is still relevant to the problems faced by, and the solutions employed by, a large number of today’s modern applications.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** This paper introduced a novel protocol that enables efficient key lookup in a large-scale and dynamic environment; the paper shows how to utilize consistent hashing to achieve provable correctness and performance properties while maintaining a simplicity and elegance of design. The core ideas within this paper have had a tremendous impact both upon subsequent academic work as well as upon industry, where numerous popular key-value storage systems employ similar techniques. The ability to scale while gracefully handling node addition and deletion remains an essential property required by many systems today.  
 1. [MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html), 
Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, OSDI 2004.
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** The paper proposed a simple yet highly effective approach for processing large data sets in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. An impressive aspect of the design is its simplicity: it elegantly captures a common pattern that solves two critical problems faced by many developers today (scalability and fault tolerance), while still retaining a clean, easy-to-use interface that supports a wide range of applications. The impact of MapReduce has been huge. It is widely used in industry, with virtually every large company running MapReduce. As a sign of great system design, developers have adopted MapReduce in many use cases beyond its original goals and inspired many follow-on systems.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** Dynamo is a scalable and highly reliable distributed key-value store. The paper describes how Dynamo manages the tradeoffs between availability, consistency, cost-effectiveness, and performance, and explains how the system combines a variety of techniques: consistent hashing, vector clocks, sloppy quorums, Merkle trees, and gossip-based membership and failure detection protocols. In particular, the paper emphasizes the value of supporting eventual consistency in order to provide high availability in a distributed system. Dynamo evolved within Amazon to become the basis of a popular cloud service, and also inspired open-source systems such as Cassandra. 
 1. [The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1298487),Mike Burrows., OSDI 2006. 
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  The Chubby lock service provides coarse-grained locking and reliable, low-volume storage for a loosely-coupled distributed system, and is particularly useful for synchronizing activities between clients. Chubby uses Paxos internally, but exposes a lock-service API to its clients, intended to simplify its adoption by programmers. The paper was one of the first to discuss the challenges of engineering a high-availability service for use by a wide range of programmers in a globally-distributed environment. While Chubby itself is widely used only within Google, the paper inspired open-source implementations of similar services, such as Zookeeper, that provide similar functionality. 
    
### Virtual Machine Monitor

- [Basic Knowledge of VMM](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vmm-intro.pdf)

 1. [A virtual machine time-sharing system](http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.93.0199),R. A. Meyer and L. H. Seawright. IBM Systems Journal 9(3), September 1970, 199- 218. 
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper described the second generation of the very first virtual machine system. It was originally built in 1966 for an IBM 360/40 with custom virtual memory hardware and then ported to a 360/67, which had virtual memory built in. In addition to a virtual machine monitor called CP, the system included a single user interactive system called CMS, heavily influenced by MIT’s CTSS; to support multiple users the system ran CMS in a separate VM for each user. Because of the clean architecture of the 360, CP could virtualize the hardware perfectly (except for timing dependencies and self-modifying channel programs) without binary translation, though it did have to translate the channel programs. It could run most of the existing IBM operating systems in virtual machines. CP/67 evolved into VM/370, which became the main time-sharing system for IBM mainframes.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper introduced elegant and effective techniques of hypervisor memory management. Memory ballooning allows the hypervisor to reclaim memory from a virtual machine in accordance with the unmodified guest’s operating system policies. Transparent page sharing supports efficient memory use with small overhead. The combination of active memory estimation, idle memory tax, and proportional fair sharing, along with admission-controlled memory reservation,provides the basis for service level agreements and reasoned overcommitment. This paper has been highly influential; many of its techniques have been adopted by widely-used hypervisors.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  The paper introduces log-structured file storage, where data is written sequentially to a log and continuously de-fragmented. The underlying ideas have influenced many modern file and storage systems like NetApp’s WAFL file systems, Facebook’s picture store, aspects of Google’s BigTable, and the Flash translation layers found in SSDs.

Joy, Samuel J. Leffler, and Robert S. Fabry, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) 2(3), August 1984, 181-197. 
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** This paper introduced techniques to make the file system “disk aware”, thus demonstrating the importance of understanding the interplay between hardware technology and file-system design. The structuring concept of the cylinder group, while simple, is found in some form in many current systems (including the widely-deployed Linux ext* family) and serves as an excellent example of the importance of locality in storage. The paper also introduced numerous functionality improvements, including symbolic links and atomic rename, which have since become commonplace features in modern file systems.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  This paper was the first to describe the use of caching to provide availability in addition to improved performance in a distributed setting where clients use files stored at remote file servers, leading to potential loss of service during disconnection. The Coda design provided a thoughtful and elegant approach to supporting continued service during disconnection. Disconnected clients continued to service user requests using locally cached content; however all potential modifications performed while disconnected were logged locally, and when service was restored the system attempted to reconcile the local modifications with the current server state. The Coda design inspired much follow-on research on distributed file systems and its techniques were adopted in other systems.
 1. [The Google File System](http://research.google.com/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf),Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, and Shun-Tak Leung.,SOSP 2003
    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**   This paper presented an effective design for a large-scale distributed file system that provided fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware. It provided very large amounts of I/O bandwidth by having all data transfers happen directly between client processes and machines storing the actual data, handled automatic recovery from failed disks and machines, and retained the simplicity of managing file system metadata in a single centralized master. GFS formed the basis for the design for the open-source HDFS system, as well the backbone for the evolution of large-scale distributed file systems at Google and elsewhere.

     - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** This paper demonstrated that compiler or code-rewriting techniques could isolate untrusted code modules, preventing them from writing or jumping to addresses outside their “fault domain”, without the overhead of crossing hardware-enforced address space boundaries, and without much increase in execution time of code within a domain. The paper inspired substantial subsequent research, and the basic techniques have been implemented in widely-deployed software, such as Web browsers.

     - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award**  The paper demonstrated that the execution of an arbitrary program inside a virtual machine can be replayed deterministically and efficiently. Originally intended primarily as a tool for intrusion analysis, record-and-replay has been used subsequently for debugging, fault-tolerance, to audit program executions, and other virtual machine services. The work has directly influenced commercial products and sparked a research area that continues to this day.

    - **SIGOPS: The Hall of Fame Award** This paper introduced the notion of proof carrying code (PCC) and showed how it could be used for ensuring safe execution by kernel extensions without incurring run-time overhead. PCC turns out to be a general approach for relocating trust in a system; trust is gained in a component by trusting a proof checker (and using it to check a proof the component behaves as expected) rather than trusting the component per se. PCC has become one of the cornerstones of language-based security.
